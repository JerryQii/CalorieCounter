# Calorie Counter

## Introduction   
The main purpose of this application is to *keep track of the foods you eat 
and calculate the total amount of their calories*. You can select the food
you eat with a specific amount then the application will keep the information 
and show you the individual food's calories and the total calories. You can 
also add new kinds of food to the application to make sure it will cover
your diet. 

There are **three** kinds of this application's targeted users:
- The people who want to lose weight.
- The People who want to maintain their current body shape.
- The people who want to build up their muscles.

This project interests me because the topic of body shape troubles a
lot of people including me that want to make some progress on it. In
this case, an application that records the approximate calorie intake
per day can help people achieve their goals in a more scientific way 
and encourage them to keep a healthy lifestyle.
